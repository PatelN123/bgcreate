# bgcreate
Create background images with particles or paint tool and download them to your local device.

**NOTE** : The application is currently being ported to react for design changes, updates and various improvements. Also, it is an old, *somewhat incomplete*, project being revisited so there may not be consistent updates.

Current version is deployed [here](https://bgcreate.netlify.com/).

Incase you still want to checkout the old application *( not advisable )*, you can visit [here](https://rishichawda.github.io/bgcreate/).

* A few bugs to fix later.
